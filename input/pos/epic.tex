  On the Software Delivery team since June 2021. Within a quarter of
  transfer, became project direction lead and the team's de-facto
  expert resource for SVN to Git migration for $\approx 3,000$
  software developers. 80\% of source control activity is to a
  multi-trunk (patch promotion) monorepo of over 6\,million commits
  across $>15$ years.
  % While we use \software{GitLab} as the repository host, we do not
  % use its workflows, opting instead to implement our own for quality
  % and regulatory reasons to integrate with existing quality tracking
  % and release processes.
  %
  \emph{Designed all the fundamentals} of each developer workflow (and
  many of the finer details) while integrating into our existing
  quality tracking and software delivery processes. \emph{Fostered
    developer ownership} in the larger team after meeting
  proof-of-concept.

\item Identified and averted multiple disaster scenarios (by designing
  a new system) within four months of transferring teams.
\item Git technical expert for our custom SVN replay solution.
% patch-based merges to St1/Final
%
% security vulnerabilities in trusting client hooks
%
% BM0 (SVN+Git)
%
% BM1 (SVN|Git)
\item Designed a standard pull request / merge queue workflow using
  pure Git functionality sitting atop pre-existing database
  infrastructure. New workflow improved end-user developer performance
  perception from tens of minutes to $<10$ seconds.
%\item Designed a minimal and stable cherry-pick process to promote
%  changes.
\item Designed and prototyped (and then handed off) new tooling
  infrastructure to our team of 20 developers. New tooling is designed
  from the ground up to teach people how to use Git well.
\item Designed, generated, and consulted for end-user developer
  training materials: video demos, written lessons, and written
  projects/exams.
\item Taught internal support team the necessary knowledge of Git
  internals and the major components of the system in order to provide
  effective support to end-user developers.
\item Designed and implemented comprehensive developer documentation
  solution for the new tooling using unfamiliar technologies.
\item Designed and implemented automated integrated testing solution
  to systematically prevent regressions.
\item Identified performance optimizations for downloading
  pre-compiled binaries using tools not yet used by the team resulting
  in a $>10\%$ boost.
\item During a company-wide performance escalation, spent two days to
  independently identify new opportunities to reduce size of all
  delivered scripts by 11\% using unfamiliar technologies.

  concurrently-supported versions.  Implement multiple data model
  conversions to support current and future technical needs
  (\censor{M}).
\item Responsible for a major integrated component of our software
  over entire tenure \Dash with many projects spanning the course of
  several months (\censor{M}, \censor{VB6}, \CSharp, JS, TS).
%\item Work closely with other teams to provide a consistent user
%  experience.
\item Work with core infrastructure teams to design and implement
  developer tooling \Dash including \censor{a new TypeScript-based
    language that compiles to M}.
%\item[\importantpoint] Lead a cross-role effort to streamline our
%  team's use of automated testing and overcome technical challenges
%  specific to our domain.  Establish team-wide processes.
%\item[\importantpoint] Establish team-wide processes to ensure our
